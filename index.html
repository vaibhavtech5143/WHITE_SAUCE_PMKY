        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat a saucepan. Keep the heat to low and add 2 tablespoons butter.
            You can use salted or unsalted butter.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the butter melts and starts to bubble, add 1 tablespoon whole
            wheat flour (atta) or choose to swap 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
            (maida) with the whole wheat flour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using a wired whisk, stir the flour quickly as soon as you add it.
            Keep stirring so that no lumps are formed. The frequent stirring
            helps the flour to cook evenly. You will see the flour frothing and
            bubbling up while stirring. Sauté until you get a nice cooked aroma
            and the flour is a pale golden color. Don’t brown the flour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep heat on low and pour 1 cup cold or chilled milk in a gentle
            stream with one hand and stir the sauce mixture with the other.
          </li>
          <li>Stir frequently, while the milk heats up.</li>
          <li>
            On low heat, simmer the sauce till it thickens. When the sauce has
            thickened well and coats the back of a spoon, turn off the heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the saucepan from the heat and place on the kitchen
            countertop. Add the seasonings, ¼ teaspoon black pepper powder, a
            generous pinch of nutmeg powder or grated nutmeg and salt as
            required. For a cheese sauce, you can add 2 tablespoons of
            grated/shredded cheddar cheese or 1 to 2 tablespoons of grated
            vegetarian parmesan cheese.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix very well and set aside. Keep in mind that the sauce will
            thicken as it cools, so keep the consistency accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>Boil 4 cups water with ½ teaspoon salt in a pan.</li>
          <li>When the water comes to a boil, add 1 cup penne pasta.</li>
          <li>Cook the pasta on a medium to high heat.</li>
          <li>
            When the pasta gets done to an al dente texture, turn off the heat.
            For a more softer texture, cook the pasta a little longer. Strain
            the pasta with a large strainer spoon.
          </li>
          <li>Then, add the cooked penne pasta to the prepared white sauce.</li>
          <li>
            Add ¼ teaspoon each of dried oregano, dried basil and dried thyme.
            Or add your choice of herbs. At this step, you can add some steamed,
            cooked, sautéed or roasted vegetables too, if you like.
          </li>
          <li>Mix very well.</li>
          <li>
            Serve White Sauce Pasta garnished with some fresh herbs like
            parsley, cilantro, basil, chives or dill. You can also garnish with
            some grated cheddar cheese.
          </li>
